# MIT: Slavic Flame License

**Song of Rod, Keeper of Origins**  
© 2025 Nikita Zhukov (ProudRykar), Heir of the Slavic Spirit

In the name of Rod, who flows in rivers and whispers in oak groves, in the name of Lada, who weaves the harmony of the world, and in the name of Perun, who punishes falsehood, this creation — Zmey Gorynych and all its heads (hereinafter "Flame") — is granted to all sons and daughters of the earth beneath the Slavic sun. May each who takes this gift wield it with honor and conscience, as the ancestors decree.

## Definitions
- **"Zmey Gorynych"**: The programming language created by [copyright holder's name], including its specification, rules, and intent.  
- **"Heads"**: All embodiments of Zmey Gorynych, including source code, compilers, interpreters, standard libraries, documentation, and other materials crafted for its function or support.  
- **"Flame"**: Zmey Gorynych and all its heads together, as a single creation subject to this covenant.  
- **"Recipient"**: Any person or community that takes the Flame for use, modification, or sharing.

## Grant of Rights  
To every Recipient who accepts this Flame, freedom is granted:  
- To weave new patterns (copy, modify, merge),  
- To share with the community (distribute, publish),  
- To pass into other hands (sublicense or sell),  
subject to the covenants below.

## Covenants of the Flame  
1. **Mark of Origin**:  
   - The Recipient must preserve this song of rights (copyright notice) and the words of these covenants in all copies of the Flame or its parts, so the ancestors’ spark does not fade.  
   - Modified versions of the Flame must bear a clear mark that the Recipient has wrought changes, with their nature declared.  

2. **Purity of Intent**:  
   - The Flame must not become a tool of malice or ruin. Forbidden evil intents are as follows:  
     - Crafting weapons that devastate land and peoples (weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, or biological).  
     - Trading in souls or living bodies (human trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced labor).  
     - Peering into secrets without their keeper’s will (mass surveillance, theft or sale of personal data).  
     - Sowing discord and falsehood among people (discrimination by kin, faith, tribe, age, form, or other nature).  
     - Destroying life without need (violence, except to shield hearth, community, or the innocent).  
     - Weaving webs of harm (malicious code that breaks others’ work or endangers their lives).  
   - The Recipient must not wield the Flame where more than half its fruits (income or other gain) stem from these evil deeds.

3. **Share of the Community**:  
   - If the Recipient alters the Flame, they must declare it plainly — in writing or where the Flame is shared (e.g., a code repository), so kin may know what was added to the common pyre.  

4. **Judgment of Perun**:  
   - Should a dispute arise over whether the "Purity of Intent" covenants are breached, the Recipient and the Keeper of the Flame (copyright holder) may call upon a community tribunal — an impartial mediator — to judge with honor within 30 days of the summons.  
   - If the Recipient rejects the tribunal or fails to mend the breach within this time, their right to the Flame is extinguished, and their freedom to wield it is lost.

## Shield of the Ancestors  
This Flame is given "as is," like a blaze in the night — radiant, yet without oaths of its might. Neither the creator nor its keepers bear blame for woes that may come from hands that hold the Flame, be it by chance, human fault, or other forces, so long as this accords with the laws of the land.

## Invocation  
Let the Flame burn freely, like a spring bonfire, and warm the fields of creation. Should any break these covenants, let it weigh on their soul, and may Perun judge with truth. So be it, from now until the end of time!
